# Project Sun
My goal is to create a modern interpretation of C&C: Tiberian Sun while being realistic of my (and Unity's) limitations and also not opening myself to a lawsuit.
I also plan on adding features that I would have wanted when I played as a kid, and, of course, mod support.

Disclaimers:
 * This project is not in a playable state. This will be the case for as long as this disclaimer exists. If you're upset by this, feel free to contribute!
 * This project is made in Unity 2022.3.22f1 because it just happened to be what I had installed. This will likely be changed later!
 * I am not trying to step on anyones toes. I am not attemptiong to infringe or break the copyright or trademarks of Westwood Studios, Electronic Arts, or other relevant parties (I don't want to get sued!) The goal of this project is not to rip-off C&C:TS, but to instead make a modern, open-source, spiritual successor that gives that same tingly feeling I had as a kid playing C&C games. This project, while heavily inspired by C&C, is not an "upgrade", "republish", or "redistribution" of any existing game, tardemark, or IP, and contains no textures, audio, or other assets except those ownd by me, those which I own a license, or otherwise am allowed to use.

This project is open to contributors! If you want to help with the development of this project, feel free to do a pull request!
